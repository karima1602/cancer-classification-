In this project I tried to make a classification of database samples
'breast_cancer' and 'lung_cancer' using different techniques also visualizing
the dispersion of data which allows us to analyze data and give predictions
either the behavior of the tumor or the response to treatment.

This project is realised in the R programming language using the RStudio interface.
